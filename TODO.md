- fix `Warning: extensions/v1beta1 Ingress is deprecated in v1.14+, unavailable in v1.22+; use networking.k8s.io/v1 Ingress`
- probably find a way to codeify creating namespaces and deploying manifests there
- update k3s version
- use terraform local executor to run ansible playbook after vm provisioning
- figure out if there is a debian image with qemu-guest-agent preinstalled
