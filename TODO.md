- fix `Warning: extensions/v1beta1 Ingress is deprecated in v1.14+, unavailable in v1.22+; use networking.k8s.io/v1 Ingress`
- style drone manifests like all other manifetsts
- add persistence for drone's postgres statefulset
- set up gitea ssh
- probably find a way to codeify creating namespaces and deploying manifests there
